             Budget Planner<br><br>  
College is a critical time in a young person’s life. Entering college means a lot of change for students: choosing a career path, broadening your social circle, and truly establishing your independence for the first time. This time of increased responsibility is the perfect time to develop healthy financial habits, and it all starts with creating and adhering to a budget. If you’re new to budgeting, then you’re not alone. Students are suddenly given free reign to manage their time and finances as they see fit, likely for the first time without any form of supervision.<br><br>


If a student hasn’t been educated on budgeting before, whether from their parents or in high school, then making the transition to financial independence can be difficult. Budgeting is a challenge for even the most seasoned adults, but it may not even be on a student’s radar. It is also important because the college years can be some of the most expensive times of a young adult’s life, and many don’t fully realize it.<br><br>

 If you don't create a student budget you could find yourself hard up for cash, meaning you might miss out on the things you enjoy, while struggling to afford the essentials.<br><br>
